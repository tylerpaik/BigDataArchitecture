# Current Docker Usage

Basic containerization, now with a handy makefile! Just make sure you have docker on your computer to test it out.

To start:

- Make sure you are in the "bone" folder

- Use the command "make run" to build the container.

- Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to see the site in its glory!

- Use the command "make clean" to remove the container when done.
